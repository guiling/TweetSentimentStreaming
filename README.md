TweetSentimentStreaming
=======================

Analyze real-time Twitter sentiment with HBase in HDInsight
Social web sites are one of the major driving forces for Big Data adoption. Public APIs provided by sites like Twitter are a useful source of data for analyzing and understanding popular trends. In this tutorial, you will develop a console streaming service application and an ASP.NET Web application to perform the following:



Get geo-tagged Tweets in real-time using the Twitter streaming API.
Evaluate the sentiment of these Tweets.
Store the sentiment information in HBase using the Microsoft HBase SDK.
Plot the real-time statistical results on Bing maps using an ASP.NET Web application. A visualization of the tweets will look something like this:

hdinsight.hbase.twitter.sentiment.bing.map

You will be able to query tweets with certain keywords to get a sense of the expressed opinion in tweets is positive, negative, or neutral.
